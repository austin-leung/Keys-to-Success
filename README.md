## Problem: 
Return the boolean value of the statement “there exists one path through a maze
starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure”.

## Recursive Abstraction: 
When I am asked to return the boolean value of the statement “there exists one path through a maze
starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure”, the recursive abstraction can move the explorer to the next legal position in the maze.
