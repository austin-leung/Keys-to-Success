## Problem: 
What is the boolean value of the statement /n
>there exists a path through a maze starting at a designated beginning and ending at treasure?

## Recursive Abstraction: 
When I am asked to return the boolean value of the statement 
>there exists one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure, 
the recursive abstraction can return the boolean value of the statement 
>there exists one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning ending at treasure
for an adjacent stepping stone that has not been visited before.
